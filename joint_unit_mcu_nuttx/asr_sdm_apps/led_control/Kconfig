    ---help---
        Enable the simple LED control application for XIAO RP2350 board.

        This application provides basic LED control functions:
        - LED on/off control
        - LED blinking with custom period

        Note:
        - Requires USERLED and USERLED_LOWER to be enabled in NuttX.
        - ARCH_LEDS should be disabled to avoid conflicts with board LEDs.

	# 2KB is sufficient for simple CLI parsing and ioctl calls.
